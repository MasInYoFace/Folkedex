The leader pats a steady beat around the circle, tapping each student’s shoe as everyone speaks the rhyme. On the last beat of the rhyme, the student on whom the beat lands says how old they are. The beat continues around the circle for however old the student is. (For example, if the student is seven, the beat passes seven more shoes.) 
When the beat lands on the final shoe, that person’s foot is eliminated from the game. They tuck it underneath them, out of the circle, so one foot is still in the game and one foot is out. Continue until all shoes are eliminated.

A “Witch” is selected to hide in the corner of the room.
Craney Crow leads the Chickens in a march around the front of the Witch’s hiding place, singing in a taunting manner.
At the words, “What time, Old Witch?” the Witch rushes from her hideout, seizes a Chicken, takes it to her hiding place, and calls out “One.”
The Chickens again form a line behind Craney Crow and the game is resumed from the beginning. As the Witch seizes the second Chicken, she answers to the question, “What time, Old Witch?” the word “Two,” and soon “Three, Four, etc.,” until twelve Chickens have been seized. In case the number of players is small, the Witch seizes half of Craney Crow’s Chickens.
After this has been done, the singing stops; the Witch draws a line on the ground with a stick, and the Chickens behind the Witch and the Chickens behind Craney Crow pull against each other. The first child pulled across the line on the Witch’s side becomes the new Witch; the first child pulled across the line on Craney Crow’s side becomes the new Craney Crow, and the game is begun again from the very beginning.

Two students make a tree by holding hands while the third student, “Squirrel”, stands between the tree.
While singing, the tree students move their hands back and forth. At the end of the song, the tree students rase and the Squirrels scatter to find a new tree. The game works best when there are extra Squirrels that must find an open tree.
